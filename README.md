## 🌟 Why I Built This

I’m **Kunal Lad** — a husband, a father, and a self-taught developer grinding night shifts in a BPO while learning to code by day.

Every component in this portfolio is more than just code — it’s a reflection of my dream to give my family a better life.  
This is not just a website. It’s **my story in code**.
